    <h3>What to Do:</h3>

            <li>Take out a cup. If you really want to be like me, it should be a red cup.</li>
            <li>Put the cereal in your cup. You can pour as much as you would like. Same for the rest of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Next, add the raisins, or whatever dried fruit/ add-in you would like.</li>
            <li>Next, add the honey.</li>
            <li>Pour the milk over the honey. Try to pour the milk over all the honey, so that the top looks milky.</li>
            <li>Lastly, mix everything together!</li>

    <p>I came up with this cereal-elevating receipe when I wanted cereal but did not want it to be basic. I also wanted my cereal to be sweeter, hence the honey. So, I looked in my fridge to see what I could use, and these extra ingredients are what I had. This is catered to <em>my</em> taste buds, so feel free to customize this recipe to your liking. I make this when I'm hungry. <br/> Also, the red cup included in the ingredients is becuase I love eating out of cups, and I really feel that eating out of cups elevates the experience. Try it! You never know. You may soon love to eat out of cups as much as I do.</p>
