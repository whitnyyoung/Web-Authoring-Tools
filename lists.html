        <ol>
            <li>Take out a cup. If you really want to be like me, it should be a red cup.</li>
            <li>Put the granola-like cereal in your cup. I'm using a granola-like cereal for this recipe.</li>
            <li>Next, add the raisins, or whatever dried fruit/ add-in you would like.</li>
            <li>Next, add the honey.</li>
            <li>Pour the milk over the honey. Try to pour the milk over all the honey, so that the top looks milky.</li>
            <li>Lastly, mix everything together!</li>
