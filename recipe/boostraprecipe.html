    <h3>by Taylor Roper</h3>
    <p>I came up with this cereal-elevating receipe when I wanted cereal but did not want it to be basic. I also wanted my cereal to be sweeter, hence the honey. So, I looked in my fridge to see what I could use, and these extra ingredients are what I had. This is catered to <em>my</em> taste buds, so feel free to customize this recipe to your liking. I make this when I'm hungry. <br/> Also, the red cup included in the ingredients is becuase I love eating out of cups, and I really feel that eating out of cups elevates the experience. Try it! You never know. You may soon love to eat out of cups as much as I do.</p>
